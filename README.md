# Hi Koala team

Just want to say you have interesting general test. Really like the API and the Golang test, really enjoying it.

If there anything that is not correct, please give me some feedback.

The answer and questions of the test should be in the file `take-home-questions.md`.

I also push some data file `students.json` and `phnumbers/*` in case you need it.

Looking forward to hearing from Koala team :blush:.

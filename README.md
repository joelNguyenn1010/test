# Hi Koala team

Just want to say you have an interesting general test. Really enjoying the API and the Golang question.

If there anything that is not correct, please give me some feedbacks.

The answers and questions of the test should be in the file `take-home-questions.md`.

I also push some data file `students.json` and `phnumbers/*` in case you need it.

The weather widget question should be in different repo, [click here](https://github.com/joelNguyenn1010/weather-widgets)

Looking forward to hearing from Koala team :blush:.

## Weather Widget

The purpose of this test is for us to get a sense of how you would approach designing and implementing a JavaScript/CSS/HTML weather widget. Applicants are encouraged to write code for this test as for a production grade application.

There's more than one way to skin a cat, therefore feel free to list down your assumptions as you go along (e.g. in code comments).

Although not required, you can use any js framework you like. To showcase your front-end skills as part of this test, you may want to avoid using UI libraries.

### Requirements

Based on the wireframe (weather-widget.jpg), create a “weather widget” app that:

1. Shows your location's current and future weather data.
2. Able to search a specific location weather data.
3. Has a dark / light mode.
4. Adheres to minimum AA accessibility guidelines.

Wireframes are intentionally left plain for maximum creativity! A delightful use of animations is a plus.

##### Widget

The widget should read the end user’s current location using `navigator.geolocation` (or the entered location), and retrieve the current weather conditions for that location using the [Open Weather Map API](https://openweathermap.org/api). Defaulted to the current time, users should be able to navigate between the days. (see image included)

### Deliverables

There is no strict time limit (unless agreed upon) but most people get back to us within a few days. Source code for the solution described above: share your repository, upload it as an accessible link or forward a zip file of the source code.
